# Getting started for a research group

# Group leader

## 1. Register
As first step, you have to create your profile/account? in DataHub. Follow the link to see how to [register](it is config dependent - page to be made?) or (registering.html)?.

## 2. Login
To start organising your research, you must me logged in. Follow the link to see how to [login](login.html).

## 3. Create a Programme
Create a Programme to group all your research projects under it. The title of the Programme could be the name of your laboratory or of your research unit. Follow the link to see how to [create a Programme](create-programme.html).

By default, you will be the only Programme administrator, but you can [add more profiles](?) later to so that more people can administer the Programme or help you.

Note that it is possible to create a new Programme with a new Project within, in one go. Follow the link to see how to [create a Project](create-project.html).

## 4. Create a research Project
Now, you have to create a Project. A Project in DataHub should correspond to a research project of a PhD student or a PostDoc in your group or a larger research project (such as an ERC). Take into account that each Project can be further splitted in more than one Investigation.

See example of how to [organise your research]() in DataHub.

Follow the link to see how to [create a Project](create-project.html) - this is instance specific
By default, you will be assigned as member and administrator of the created Project. This can be changed later.

## 5. Add members to the Project and manage their roles
Assign researchers or lab staff that will manage the research and/or perform the experiments to the Project. To this end, each researcher or staff must have a profile in DataHub. 

Project members can have different roles, so make sure to assign the appropriate role to the right researcher or staff in your group.

See example of how to rganise roles??? needed?

Follow the link to see the different [roles](roles.html).
Follow the link to see how to [administer project members](administer-project-members.html).

# Researcher

## 1. Register
As first step, you have to create your profile/account? in DataHub. Follow the link to see how to [register](it is config dependent - page to be made?) or (registering.html)?.

## 2. Login
To start organising your research, you must me logged in. Follow the link to see how to [login](login.html).

## 3. Become member or administrator of a Project
After loggin in, you have to join a Project.
If your group leader adds you to a Project, you will receive an email?
Follow the link to see how to [join a project](join-a-project.html)

If your group leader adds your profile as Project Administrator, you have special capabilities to administer the project.
Follow the link to see the [roles](role.html) and how to [administer project members](administer-project-members.html).

## 4. Create Protocols
Protocols of experimental steps or data analysis must be registered in DataHub in order to be associated with ISA Studies and ISA Assays.

### Where to register your protocols
Protocols for a research group can be grouped into 
* a dedicated Project (only for protocols) within a Programme or they 
* within a research Project.

Follow the link to see how to [register a protocol](adding-assets.html)

A registered protocol can be associated to multiple ISA Studies and ISA Assays, according to the sharing permission rules set for the specific protocol.

Follow the link to see how to apply [sharing-permission](general-attributes#sharing.html)

## 5. Go to Single Page
Visualise the Project in Single Page to start documenting your experiments.

Follow the link to see how to [view the project in Single Page](view-project-in-single-page.html).

## 6. Design an ISA Investigation
An ISA Investigation could be a part of a bigger research project or an aspect of a research project (e.g. in vivo studies). It is a way to group related ISA Studies. Even if there is no need to firther group the research, an Investigation must be created and could be titled as the Project.

See example of how to [organise your research](example).

Follow the link to see how to [design an ISA Investigation in Single Page](designing-experiments-in-single-page#isainvestigation).

## 7. Design an ISA Study
An ISA Study is a central concept containing information on the subject under study (or observation unit), its characteristics and any treatments applied. A Study is a particular hypothesis, which you are planning to test, using various techniques.

See example of how to [organise your research](example).

Follow the link to know more about what constitutes an [ISA Study](isa-single-page-advanced#isastudy).

Follow the link to see how to [design an ISA Study in Single Page](designing-experiments-in-single-page#isastudy).

## 8. Add Sources to ISA Study
