# Creating a Project

You will first be prompted to create (or [Join a Project](./join-a-project.html)) following registering a new FAIRDOM-SEEK account. If you are already a member and wish to add additional Projects, you can choose to create a Project from the _Create_ menu in the top bar.

## Choosing a Programme

If enabled, first a Programme will need to be chosen or created. If configured, you will also have the option to choose a site managed Programme. By default, the site managed Programme is selected, but if unchecked there is an option to provide the title of a new one. Only the title is required at this stage, but further details can be provided later once created.

If you already administer existing Programmes, a dropdown box will be shown instead allowing you to select one of your existing Programmes. You will also have the option to create a new one.

## Defining the Project

You next need to define the Project. At a minimum a title is required, but you can also here provide a description and webpage. Once created you can edit and add additional details and add members.

## Defining your Institution

When the Project is created, you will automatically become a member along with its administrator.
To become a member you also have to describe the institution (or affiliation) that you are associated with in relation to this Project. It doesn't have to be the same Institution as other Projects, and it is not unusual for it to be different.

Start to type the name of your institution, and existing options will be displayed that contain the text you type (or related to the Institution such as City). Hopefully your institution is found and you can just select it. If not, you can choose the top option to define a new one.

If describing a new Institution only the title is required, but you can also provide details about its website, city and country. You will also be able to edit and add additional information afterwards.

## Approval step

If you are creating a Project within a Programme you administer, then there is no approval step. You will be shown a page to review the details and then create straight away.

Otherwise, an appropriate administrator will be notified by email about your request. They will also be notified directly when using FAIRDOM-SEEK. The administrator will be shown a page that allows them to quickly review the details and either accept or reject the request, and in either case you will be notified by email.
