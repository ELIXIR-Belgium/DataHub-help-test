# Create a Programme

Once you have [registered](registering.html) and logged in, you will be able to create a Programme. You can do so from Create menu at the top of the screen.

This will take you to a form to fill out to describe the Programme. The title is required and must be unique, other fields are optional but encouraged if you want your Programme to be accepted.
Once it has been created you will also be able to change the logo picture. Click the Create button at the bottom of the form to create the Programme.

You will now need to wait until the Programme has been activated by an administrator. The administrators will have been sent an email, will review the Programme and either accept of reject it. If rejected you will be provided with a reason. It is possible an administrator will contact you during this review process.
The Programme will not appear in lists or search results until it has been activated.

Once either Accepted or Rejected you will be notified by email.

After its creation and likely acceptance you will automatically become the default [Programme Administrator](roles.html#programme-administrator). Follow the link to find out what you can do next, such as creating a Project.
