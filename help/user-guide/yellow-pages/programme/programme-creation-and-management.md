# SEEK admin settings for Programmes

# Administrator details

The following are details that apply only to SEEK system administrators.

## Programme Activation

If you are a SEEK administrator you may receive an email notifying you that a Programme has been created and requires activation.

This email will contain details about the Programme, who created it and also includes a link that you can follow to Accept or Reject the Programme - you need to be logged into SEEK to do this.

If you reject the programme, you will be asked for an explanation which will be passed on to the user that created it. If rejected, the Programme won't automatically be deleted and there is still the opportunity to Accept it again later
 if your reasons for rejection are addressed. You can also come back later and delete it if necessary.

## Disabling Programme creation

If you run your own installation of SEEK, you can disable both Programmes and also separately the ability for users to create
their own Programmes. This will mean the Programmes, and therefore also Projects can only be created by a full administrator.

The option to turn these on or off are available in the Server Admin area, under Site configuration and Enable/disable features.
