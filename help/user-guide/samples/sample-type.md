# Sample Type

Sample Type is a form with samples' attributes needed to describe and create Samples in SEEK. A Sample type must be associated with one or more Projects.

By default, any member of a Project may create a Sample Type and associate with that Project. By default the Sample Type will only be visible to members of that
 project until it has publicly accessible Samples associated with it. See [Sample Type Visibility](#sample-type-visibility) .

A SEEK Administrator can change the configuration such that Sample Types can only be created by the Project Administrator.
